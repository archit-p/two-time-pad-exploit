# Exploit for Multi-Time Pad

## Problem 
Given k ciphertexts encrypted using a OTP style stream cipher using the same key, decrypt the k+1th ciphertext.

## Files
1. exploit-two-time-pad.py - the main script
2. ciphers.txt - txt file to enter ciphertexts one per line
3. target.txt - target ciphertext to decrypt
4. decrypt.txt - output file for the decrypted message.

## Approach
The key is guessed using:
> 1. Given two ciphertexts c1 and c2 for plaintext messages m1 and m2 respectively, c1 xor c2 gives m1 xor m2.
> 2. For any character c in [a-zA-Z], c xor <space> reverses the case of the character.
